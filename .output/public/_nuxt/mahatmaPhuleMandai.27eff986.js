This shifted to an indoor place built by the Poona Municipality. The construction of the Gothic style building started in 1882 and took 4 years for completion. It was designed and built by Walter Ducat and Vasudeo Kanitkar with significant input from engineer Narso Ramchandra Godbole.[1] The Market at opening was named after the then Governor of Bombay, Lord Reay, and served as a retail and wholesale market in addition to being the Municipal office. There was also an older market district called Tulshi Baug close to the vegetable market that sold a variety of household items.[2] [3] The wholesale market was moved to the outskirts of the city in the late 1970s to the newly built Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard at Gultekdi. The Municipal offices moved to a purpose built new building in the Shivajinagar area of the city many decades ag </div></div><div class="sticky bottom-5 pb-10"><div class="mx-auto bg-black rounded-full md:w-3/4"><audio controls class="mx-auto w-full"><source src="'+s+'"></audio></div></div>',4),c=[n];function h(u,m){return i(),t("div",r,c)}const b=a(l,[["render",h]]);export{b as default};
